# Restaurant Page

A simple restaurant page to test my knowledge of webpack, along with
being CSS and JS DOM manipulation practice. Also is the first project
using JS Modules to import code from other files. 

Features To-Do List:
- Make the Locations page a proper maps lookup
- Finish the home page with the CSS for existing HTML elements
- Implement functionality for the other 4 tabs
